				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything is a blur &#8211; the trip was for 3 days but I spent more than half of that in the air, waiting in airports &amp; in a hotel in dubai.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Surprisingly managed to see a lot: 1400 yrs old Omayad Mosque, Old Town Damascus Souk with Roman columns, Azem Palace, Walls of Damascus, Damascus Opera House backstage, view from Cassoun Mountain, Cultural Museum..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Very interesting place &#8211; Romans, Greeks, Christians &amp; Muslims have all passed through or had their civilizations there at some point in time.<br />
(Oldest inhabited city in the world)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the 27hrs I was there, the people were nice enough to me (aside from the pushing &amp; shoving at the airport) and its a very safe place. Of course army and civil policemen were a common sight, more so because the President swore in his new Cabinet while I was there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So even though the Government is not someone you want to mess with &#8211; the ladies are more open. Ladies can go about with or without head scarves and a lot of young ladies go around with tight T-shirts, jeans and flowing locks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall a place that needs some exploration beneath the surface to enjoy. Don&#8217;t piss off the Government <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  And cross into Israel at your own risk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s not ask about where else I&#8217;m going to next..I&#8217;m going to sleep now zzzzzz&#8230;.</p>
