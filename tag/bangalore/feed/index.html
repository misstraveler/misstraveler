				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>wow it&#8217;s been a crazy 2 months.</p>
<p>Been filling out so many forms that now I see little boxes everywhere, mailing off stuff, getting my insides x-rayed..and now the australian government says that my engrish ish no gewd sew me gotta taking the engreesh test&#8230;</p>
<p>ARRGGGHHHHHH</p>
<p>I really need a holiday, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing anymore. In short, in 2 months I have obtained a British visa, an Indian visa &#038; am trying to get an Australian visa. I can now add those to my collection of Chinese, Japanese, UAE, USA visas :p</p>
<p>Does anyone want to go to Bangkok? Me and Lin are planning a food/shopping-fest before I go to London..</p>
<p>THAT&#8217;S RIGHT! I am finally (yes, after all that hee-hawing) going to London!! Am I excited??? You think??</p>
<p>woo hoo hoo&#8230;.</p>
<p>Anyway I start work 4th June, trying to set everything up to arrive 31st May&#8230; so before that I am trying to fit in a trip to Bangkok, surf trip to Phuket, dive trip to Tioman, paintball, a wedding&#8230;and my first Cheng Beng (Festival of the Souls). Grandpa passed away less than 2 weeks ago. Try not to think too much about it, but he was an old bloke who lived a happy and long life.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t able to be there for the funeral but I went down to pay last respects the day before I flew to India (business trip).</p>
<p>India was..hehe really interesting but smelly <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  Bright colors everywhere, I was really keen to see Bangalore, Sillicon Valley outside of the US! I got to eat some really fantastic Indian food (and paid the price later), got to see a new culture &#8211; and Bangalore is really beautiful with lakes, and gardens, and cows everywhere! hehe. Densely populated, in 25 years they expect the population to increase to 16 million! Just a big infrastructure/housing/legislative/etc.. headache</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t mention the traffic, if you&#8217;re not stuck in it, you might be clinging onto the seat in sheer terror at the way they drive&#8230;. I just thanked my lucky stars I had air-con all the way, and scrambled for the seat belt (there wasn&#8217;t one) Slums &#038; US$2million mansions&#8230;drive past the gates of the Floridian gated community and you&#8217;re back in the dusty roads and the teeming humanity.</p>
<p>At Banglore airport, I was checking my gate on the ticket thinking&#8230;&#8221;ok, Gate 1&#8230;geez there are no signs (looking around), how am I going to find my gate&#8230;&#8221; And then I walked through a few halls and then realised that there was only ONE gate :p</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the end of the tales of the young and clueless&#8230;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to get jump into the tropical waters of Tioman/Phuket/ wavepool?? yuck&#8230;</p>
<p>Thai food! thai food! ohhhhh bliss<br /> <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  shi.</p>
