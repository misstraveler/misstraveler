				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">Somehow everytime I go to Paris I have a good time. Compared to London, the weather and food seems to improve the moment the eurostar goes under the channel, which is rather bizarre. Or (most probably) it&#8217;s that I&#8217;m on holiday&#8230;anyway&#8230;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Arrived on the hottest day/week of the month, even the cafes had to close as it was suffocatingly hot indoors and a lot of old buildings don&#8217;t have central air-conditioning. On the 1st sunday of every month is free museum day, although I found out that not all museums do.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">But I&#8217;d kind of been thinking of a bicycle ride by the Seine which is rather nice with leafy boulevards and water and beautiful churches and palaces and buildings. So I decided to rent a bicyle (Velib) and check out the museums on free sunday. Afterwards I realised several important things:</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">1. The musems are much further than they look on the map</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">2. There are loooong queues on free museum day</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">3. Velibs are not dirt bikes</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">4. Walking in the Louvre with blood trickling down your leg is not a good look.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">5. If your wound continues to become more swollen the day after, it may have gone septic and you will need to go to the ER. (It got better after).</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">6. Cycling in the twilight evening, along the Seine is great <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">All in all, a good trip.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Back in the room while gazing wistfully at my swollen knee, I thought out loud &#8220;Well, at least when I&#8217;m old I can tell my grandkids that grandma fell off a bicycle in Paris&#8221; &#8220;Or you mean that when grandma still had a leg&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;&#8230;!!!&#8221;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Shi</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">ps: here&#8217;s a link to pics of some of the silliness at glasto! Made me laugh out loud, I was standing next to the oompa loompas at the glasvegas concert..they are led by willy wonka, and they have a synchronised dance that they did during the concert..hahahaha&#8230;</div>
