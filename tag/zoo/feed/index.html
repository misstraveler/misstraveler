				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Wow it&#8217;s been a nice weekend! Sunny all weekend after raining all week&#8230;and now it&#8217;s raining..again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tour de france time trials around london &#8211; I am not a cycling fan but it was pretty cool to see them whizzing around the parliament houses, big ben, buckingham palace&#8230; all the tv newscasts don&#8217;t give anything about the atmosphere at the races &#8211; banging, cheering, the big screens set up, the crowds (very nice lot, these cycling fans! except for the pushy guy next to me who insisted on not pulling his elbow out of my side because he had &#8220;come early&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The races started at 3pm ; counted down by Big Ben &amp; started out somewhere next to downing street &amp; finished around buckingham palace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Buses, cars &amp; roads were shut off for the time trial route to pass through, little pedestrian bridges set up so people could pass over. But mostly walking 200m out of the way to get places&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I ended up sitting in green&#8217;s park after standing 2 hours ..lazing in glorious sun &amp; then we walked off for evening beers on a blue boat on the thames..pigged out on nachos &amp; dip. Fell asleep when I got home, exhausted (having flu didn&#8217;t help)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nice and early (if 930am counts as early on sunday) to the london zoo. Honestly, it got a little silly going thru exhibits like &#8220;aquarium&#8221; or &#8220;tropical rainforest&#8221; when I&#8217;ve been in Malaysia for a bit&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the giraffes were spectacular. I think some of my favourite animals are strange looking graceful creatures like sea turtles &amp; giraffes that move quickly as if they are moving in slo-mo. Funniest moment was at the pig exhibit &amp; realising that there was a middle-eastern family across me also looking at the pig. Mom &amp; dad looked disgusted &amp; little boy shouted at it &amp; left. hmmmm</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Walked out the wrong way &amp; climbed Primrose Hill, rewarded by great view.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Went home very tired.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now very tired &amp; flu-ey coughing my germs at everyone at work. Colleague going for hols for 2 weeks leaving me to hold up the fort! I need all the rest I can get&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So I&#8217;m going home to sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hope you like the pics.</p>
