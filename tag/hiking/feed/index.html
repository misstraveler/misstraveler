				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello,</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Spring is here and a group went 5 hours north of Melbourne to frolic in the Australian bush. We battled Friday evening peak hour traffic, arriving past midnight and walked under a magnificent canopy of stars, to set up our tents for the night.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Next morning, up Mount Fainter and set up camp under the summit. I wish I could say something silly went on, besides the massage train, tent party and lying about on assortments of towels, bags, inflatable beds and my own lilo &#8211;  yes, a lime green inflatable water toy 1800m above sea level.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Next morning, the most amazing view for morning coffee. Fresh spring water, wildflowers, wild brumbies (horses) and a shower of snow. Happy right now. I think the delayed muscle soreness will set in later&#8230;.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Also, some epic news, I am now &#8211; pretty much &#8211; a graduate! So glad it&#8217;s done (clutches head in hands) It&#8217;s been a big year. Capping it off with a trip to Asia at year end, so hope to see some of you soon <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Big love,</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Shi.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m still pretty new to Melbourne myself and so it&#8217;s always fun to be a tourist. Although it&#8217;s clear that my idea of fun is pretty twisted, but last week I was shown a taste of what&#8217;s good in Melbourne - And so commenced one of the best times I&#8217;ve had in Melbourne. South American food in Fitzroy, local ales, ciders, meat pies, Mornington wines, Sorrento vanilla slice, amazing Tasmanian produce and cooking, chocolates, french pastries and coffees, coffees, coffees. We went north to the Yarra Ranges, south to the Mornington Peninsula and wandered in the city. So awesome to explore, try new things.</p>
<div>Come visit some time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-660" title="collage_officeparty" alt="" src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/collage_officeparty.jpg" width="960" height="960" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s been a really strange month since I started work at my old company…obviously things have changed &#8211; like people going home before midnight (wimps! hehe) and a healthier regime of after-work yoga lessons, weekend paintball sessions, wall-climbing, waterfall excursion…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Could this really be the same place? Is it possible that KL is having a fresh turnaround of conventional (sweat factory) work-play schedules? Of course not, I started clocking up 10pm, midnight &amp; 4am working nights in the last 2 weeks <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it was good while it lasted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So here&#8217;s the pics of the highlights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Waterfalling was good, drove 2 hours from KL, get off highway for another 45 mins, then offroad (and I mean offroad!) for another 30mins. Walk on path for 5 mins, then scramble through rainforest for 30mins to get to pristine tropical paradise! We got the first pool and it was great to get wet after working up a sweat. Splashed around then continued climbing. We only got through 7 of the 35 falls but the last falls was really beautiful. Jin got washed down 2 of the falls &amp; almost went down the 3 rd and that would have been when we would have to trek all the way down to retrieve his body…but Hugh &amp; Dave got to him in time <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Company dinner was fun too – the theme was superheros and it was at the Shangri-la restaurant. There was She-ra, Lara Croft Buffet Raider, Poison Ivy, Spider-woman, Catwoman, Chun Li (streetfighter), the Recycling Revolutionaries (aka Poison Ivy&#8217;s Ribenaberries), Mr. Bean…obviously a majority of the people didn&#8217;t dress up, but they made up for it with poledancing, man-whoring (just Dean <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  ) The food was good – sushi, oysters, entrees (in little shot glasses), choc fountain etc And our 3d guys are genius impersonators – I must watch myself around those fellas : )</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve been having a lot of fun this past month… oh yeah and uhmm there was this small incident where I sort of broke my finger before xmas &amp; I didn&#8217;t know (yes, my doctors asked me how could you not know?) After my finger was swollen for a month I went to do xrays &amp; now my finger is in this aluminium-sponge-brace thingy… So I&#8217;ve found out that wall-climbing with 3 fingers is not easy, my pen keeps getting stuck in my brace and I now do everything left-handed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sigh. Xrays this week and my finger&#8217;s better than before but still not back to normal (at all). Chinese New Year next week &amp; I&#8217;m already eating myself silly with mandarin oranges.. so…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GONG XI FA CAI WAN SI RU YI !!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">ps: Waves are flat in msia! I&#8217;m hoping for one last swell this season…<br />
pps: Does anyone want to go to the KL Muse concert?</p>
