				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">Whee! Happy new year! Hope that you had a good time during the end of year festivities.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">So before Christmas I was in Seoul, Korea &#8211; good time to go before it got really cold, it was only 0 celsius and only once went to -13 celsius and I..had..a FANTASTIC time. Arriving in Seoul, I didn&#8217;t know what to expect. Let me first say that Koreans are a tough bunch. Historically, Korea has had long periods of war, political instability and freezing winters. There is a distinct Korean identity with Chinese and Japanese influences, and a grittiness and willingness to persevere under tough conditions.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Ok, now with the tourist talk. There was a formal tour itinerary for the first half of my trip and one of the highlights was Mount Sorak outside of Seoul. There is hiking even during winter (kit up with spikes), Buddhist temples, meditation and a giant buddha. Also the ski resort! Powder snow on the slopes, awesome time and sadly, too little time. Good reason to come back to Seoul. Next day Everland Theme Park  - steepest and longest roller coaster in Korea and an overall christmassy feeling with churros and hot chocolate.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">And a teddy bear farm, kimchi making and a lot of shopping to places selling Korean cosmetics, ginseng and semi-precious stones. Back in Seoul, Gyeongbok Palace and the Korean Blue House (residence of South Korean head of state).</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Next part. wandering solo in Seoul.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Brrr&#8230; winter down here in the Southern Hemisphere. Been needing to get out for some adventuring, so I hooked up with the mountaineering club for snow camping.</div>
<p>Getting close to nature, snow and all &#8211; sounded like a good idea. Also sounded like something interesting and fun to do, you know, cross country skiing, camping in the snow. As someone who grew up in a tropical country, sleeping outdoors in -7 degree weather was something I never thought I&#8217;d do. But I was kitted out properly, so after the first night of pitching a tent in the snow and in the dark, awoke to some truly spectacular snow covered country with not a soul in sight, except for our tents. Definitely worth it.  Snow was gorgeous and sparkly but felt like fire on the body. Cold is still cold. I was really glad to get home, where clothing doesn&#8217;t freeze solid if left outdoors and hot showers feel like the most friendly water ever. Deeper appreciation for everything after spending a weekend when your sole concern is to feed yourself and not freeze.</p>
<div>Enjoy the pics! Snow! Snow forts! Fireplaces! Ski lifts (didn&#8217;t use them)! Sunset!</div>
<div>Big love,</div>
<div>Shi.</div>
