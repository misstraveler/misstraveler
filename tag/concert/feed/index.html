UNREAL.
Glastonbury (music festival) &#8230;]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">How do you describe 6 days of living in a tent in the english countryside, seeing amazing bands, acrobats, stalls, sculptures and performers?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">UNREAL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Glastonbury (music festival) again this year &#8211; booked my ticket since December!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Day#1: Arrival.<br />
Carrying tent and setting up wasn&#8217;t too bad. Where are those tentpegs? Oh well, lots of shops so easily sorted. Sun is out, grass is green.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Day #2, #3, #4, #5: Music music music. At various times, we climb to the top of the hill, get Mum tattoos, drink organic coffee, organic cider, eat organic bread, organic big breakfasts, use all types of public loos including the &#8220;comfy crappers&#8221; (no kidding), sit on the grass, walk through mud, stand in the rain, sit on the grass, sit in the sun&#8230;listen to more music.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Night #5:<br />
Prodigy festival closer! Totally mental. Some tall guy behind me was jumping up and down and suddenly stopped. 2 seconds later felt a warm spray on my leg and I ask the guy next to me &#8220;did you drop some water?&#8221; (knowing it wasn&#8217;t, but hoping it was) &#8211; the guy in front me shouts &#8220;ew some guy&#8217;s using my leg as a tree!&#8221; At one point everyone&#8217;s crouching down on the ground &#8211; why? Because they told us to! haha.. That, and crowd-surfers, moshing with 1000s of sweaty new best friends with no room to breath. Was supposed to meet my friend, but got lost amongst 1000s of people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Afterwards I really need to wash everything off. Strip down to a bikini past midnight and subject myself to a cold wash under a tap in the middle of the campgrounds. My breath mists up as walk away feeling refreshed and tingly&#8230;only to walk up to my giggling friend who&#8217;s just happened to walk by and witness the whole scene.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Day 6:<br />
Packing up the tent. Found out where the tent pegs went to, I&#8217;d set the tent up on them. Realised what that hard lump he&#8217;d been sleeping on for the last 5 nights was <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  Heh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amazing 6 days. Not sure if I&#8217;d do 6 days again &#8211; but I will keep an eye out for when the tickets for 2010 come up!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The playlist:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dizzy Rascal, N*E*R*D, Bruce Springsteen, Badly drawn boy, Kep Domino, Bombay Bicycle Club, Prodidgy, Glasvegas, Lady Gaga, The Yeah yeah yeahs, Doves, Priscila Anh, Lily Allen, Spinal Tap, Kasabian, In case of fire, The boxer rebellion and a little of: Jason Mraz, Bon Iver and the music of the penguin cafe orchestra</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have a good one,<br />
Shi</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ps: I forgot to mention in the last email that I also spent a day in Milan. I spent most of the day on the roof of the Il Duomo trying to prise my fingers off the walls (voted #1 most scared asian tourist on the roof)..it was beautiful though <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Got home past midnight because of a signaling failure at Doncaster from York. Then up the next morning at 430 because I had collapsed into bed &amp; still hadn&#8217;t packed for Glasto.</p>
<p>As the coach pulled out of Victoria London, it was bright and sunny, spirits were high and I was amazed at how organised everything was. As we got closer to the venue, it started to drizzle and the only pit stop was selling water, wet wipes and wellingtons for 2-3 times the normal price.</p>
<p>But the drizzle stopped after the 1st day and Glasto had the best sunny weather for the first time in years! Epic indeed. There were so many great bands to see and the audiences were mostly happy and sane &#8211; except for the ones at the Amy Winehouse and Jay-Z gig. We had a rough plan to see most gigs we wanted but spent most of the time wandering in and out of different tents, more bands, Green Fields (Hippy area), organic coffee, organic sausages, organic apple cider and organic impromptu wild dancing (heehee)</p>
<p>Best thing in the world has got to be jumping up and down in a sunny grassy field to great music with good friends <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  Had such a good time I&#8217;ve already booked my ticket for 2009..so see you London people next year <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Fantastic 3 days, left glasto with a brilliant sunset back to london and the next morning hopped on a flight to Kuala Lumpur via Doha. Next email, Thailand.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Heya</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Concerts were good. Kaiser Chiefs was mosh pit fun (got a spot right in the front of the stage!) nice nice nice &#8211; they are good in concert. Jumped, shoved, sang my brains out. Shoes totalled. Brilliant night. Turin Brakes was a more &#8220;mature&#8221; crowd so more karaoke session-ey.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frost Festival was very good too. Best view just eating pie, (choc-covered) churros and mulled wine and looking at the river. Lots of little stalls, performances, stilt walkers, acrobats&#8230; Globe Theatre had an open day and that was fun too &#8211; actors running around everywhere overacting Shakespeare&#8217;s pieces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kew Gardens also had open night. Audience carolling, fun fair, carousel, snow dome (turned out to be foam) and Henry Moore sculptures. I lost a lot of feeling in my face, legs and toes that night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Heliosphere at Covent Garden finally came out after 2 weekends of lousy weather. It&#8217;s an acrobatic performance involving a female acrobat attached to a big balloon and she flies around the square, occassionally touching people on the ground. Either thrilling or sappy, you decide.</p>
<p>http://youtube.com/watch?v=cQLOfAO1Upg</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s getting pretty painful to stand outside for hours like I&#8217;ve been doing all weekend. According to BBC&#8217;s average temperature, it is actually now 3 celsius colder than last year. Not that I would know, because I wasn&#8217;t there last year so I&#8217;ll keep on trying to freeze my toes off every night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone has started leaving London for the hols&#8230;my turn next Sunday! woo!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ho ho ho<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">xmas is in full swing now..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">nice that in london there is so much choice to do the conventional xmas stuff and the unconventional xmas</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">like:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">shopping: John Lewis,Debenhams (conventional) v Spitalfield markets, Brick Lane flea markets (unconventional). Acryllic jewelley is all the rage atm, even Chanel &amp; Tate Modern have gotten into it :p I wonder if Mexican wrestling masks might make good gifts&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">xmas cookies: Design Museum where I made my own rainbow gingerbread men. Meet Selvi the Indian gingerbread woman and Frieda, the cross-dressing (at the same time) gingerbread transgender</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were also girl go-go dancers Actionettes &#8211; they were swingin! <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">St Martin in the Fields are having Christmas concerts. On Sat was audience carols &amp; my favourite (ever!): Vivaldi&#8217;s 4 seasons! Divine to hear &amp; see the fantastic skill of the lead violinist, I was in heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trafalgar&#8217;s square&#8217;s Xmas Tree &amp; Menorah (Chanukka this Tuesday)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Company Xmas dinner last week. We had it at a middle-eastern restaurant, stand-up buffet with dj &amp; free flow drinks afterwards. Can&#8217;t say it compares to a pirate xmas party, but by the end of the night you could have been a 6ft peg-legged parrot &amp; no one would have noticed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lion King was both gorgeous (costumes, make up, props) and disappointing (plot line, lead&#8217;s singing, some set design).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comedy Store (Picadilly Circus) improv Sunday night follows the same format as &#8220;whose line is it?&#8221; and I have learnt a new word to love and cherish: &#8220;Tosser!&#8221; I&#8217;m sure it must mean something good because they only said it 50 times during the show.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And they&#8217;ve got more xmas fairs set up in front of City Hall and Leicester Square.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Turin Brakes &amp; Kaiser Chiefs this week. Looking forward to it. Woo! <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s still been raining all week.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hope all is well,<br />
Shi</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ps: yes, I know what tosser means so please don&#8217;t send me emails suggesting how I might integrate using it into my daily life&#8230;<br />
