				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Heya</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Concerts were good. Kaiser Chiefs was mosh pit fun (got a spot right in the front of the stage!) nice nice nice &#8211; they are good in concert. Jumped, shoved, sang my brains out. Shoes totalled. Brilliant night. Turin Brakes was a more &#8220;mature&#8221; crowd so more karaoke session-ey.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frost Festival was very good too. Best view just eating pie, (choc-covered) churros and mulled wine and looking at the river. Lots of little stalls, performances, stilt walkers, acrobats&#8230; Globe Theatre had an open day and that was fun too &#8211; actors running around everywhere overacting Shakespeare&#8217;s pieces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kew Gardens also had open night. Audience carolling, fun fair, carousel, snow dome (turned out to be foam) and Henry Moore sculptures. I lost a lot of feeling in my face, legs and toes that night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Heliosphere at Covent Garden finally came out after 2 weekends of lousy weather. It&#8217;s an acrobatic performance involving a female acrobat attached to a big balloon and she flies around the square, occassionally touching people on the ground. Either thrilling or sappy, you decide.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s getting pretty painful to stand outside for hours like I&#8217;ve been doing all weekend. According to BBC&#8217;s average temperature, it is actually now 3 celsius colder than last year. Not that I would know, because I wasn&#8217;t there last year so I&#8217;ll keep on trying to freeze my toes off every night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone has started leaving London for the hols&#8230;my turn next Sunday! woo!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ho ho ho<br />
