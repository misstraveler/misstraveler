				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello&#8230;it&#8217;s been a while <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think that I&#8217;ve just been settling into life in Sydney, so not taking many pics anymore. But we just had a long weekend &#8211; here&#8217;s a little historical info.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 1770, the first British settlement was established in Sydney. In 1999, Australia voted to keep the British monarch as Head of State and to keep long weekends celebrating the Queen&#8217;s Birthday <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Which is funny because there was not a single event related to the queen&#8217;s birthday or British customs &amp; traditions whatsoever. Instead there was a distinct lack of traditions that made it more fun because the events of the weekend (if you were still in town) included freestyle motoX (carey hart! woo!) jazz festival, light festival (month long event, nothing related to the queen&#8217;s weekend) and visits to the sydney fish markets (just felt like it).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was more fun than Australia Day that heavily featured Aussie icons such as the clotheshanger, jumping castles, sausage sizzles, a ferry race and a pin-sized jet (that came and left in 3 seconds flat!) There was also an Aboriginal sunrise ceremony on Australia Day that only 0.00001% of the population managed to wake up for it. I was not one of them but I almost was, until I rolled over and put the alarm clock on snooze :p</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But on this queen&#8217;s birthday weekend the sun was out, the music was good and everyone danced into the sunset&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">x<br />
