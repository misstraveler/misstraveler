				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hey,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oslo was really good. Weather was perfect, sunny and 17 degrees!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Walked from Central Station, to the Royal Palace to Vigeland Sculpture Park. Lots of cafes and beautiful parks along the way. Just sat on the grass, enjoyed the sun.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vigeland Park has got these really funny statues, beautifully made, of men, women, children, babies, old men, old women..in different poses &#8211; embracing, carrying, playing &#8211; and a few of them very funny, like a toddler throwing a tantrum or a man trying to get rid of babies stuck on his body!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was just such a nice day there were people out skating, parkour-ing, acrobatics, sitting on the grass..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lovely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Weather was great again the next day, went to see a 1000 year old Viking burial ship, open-air museum with traditional Norwegian stuff, Nobel Peace Prize Museum (inspiring) and walked around Akershus Castle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">New Oslo Opera House was really cool too.. Oslo just reminded me so much of Sydney, the harbour was like Wooloomooloo, Circular Quay and Darling Harbour in one. And I did sit on a ferry..a very small one <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oslo seems to be a very young city, with a lot of young kids (babies in prams) and young parents. Everywhere I looked there were prams and these light blue-eyed babes just staring at me..hmmmm <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had a great time for sure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hope all is well,<br />
