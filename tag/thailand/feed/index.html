				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">0:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Oh my god, you are down in Koh phi phi for the weekend?&#8221;, says the open-mouthed mancunian (manchester, england). &#8220;That is&#8230;so.. amazing&#8221;. I&#8217;m not quite sure if he is still here or if it is the mixture of coke, red bull and local whiskey in a plastic bucket talking. As I paint a lightning bolt over his friend&#8217;s eye, it does feel like a lifetime since weekend trips walking on cobblestones.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">-30:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I am trying to hide the silly grin on my face as I push my stuff into my bag.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">-24:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Into a plane, off the plane, into a minivan, into a hotel on the main strip of patong phuket, trying to ignore the go-go bars and neon lights on the main strip, stare longingly at hotel pool, get some sleep.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">-16:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The air on the morning ferry to Koh Phi Phi is charged with happy excitement from travellers who have been fed Leonardo di Caprio&#8217;s Beach and like me, are anticipating Adventure. The silly grin on my face is out in the open now.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">-15:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Agent B turns up, fit as a fiddle after 1 month of climbing in Tonsai.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">-14:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Agent B is complaining about how Koh Phi Phi is not as good as Tonsai and after much pleading from me, he comes with me on the boat tour to Maya Bay.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">-9:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Our boat is boarded by a pair of hairy pirates looking for food. I jump off the boat, only to look up and see a monkey jumping off the boat on top of me. I scream like a little girl, it lands next to me in the surf and everyone bursts out laughing. I am fed up of being terrorized by furry thieves and scream at a monkey charging at me. He takes one look at the furious hairless lunatic and backs off.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">-8:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">We are snorkeling, it&#8217;s the Spanish girls&#8217; first time and I am happy, darting between coral formations and spying on the fat purple moray eel curled up beneath us.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">-7:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">A happy chinese tourist joins our group jumping photo at Maya Bay. She takes a photo with me before leaving. I&#8217;m a celebrity, haha&#8230;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">-6:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">We are cruising through a lagoon with crystal clear waters and mountains that float in the ocean and go straight up into the sky.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">-3:30h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The pad thai, green curry and nutella banana pancakes are happily sitting at the bottom of my stomach.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">-3:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Irish Paul and Lu from the boat tour run up to us! Come join us, all of us from the hostel are at the Raggae Bar.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">-1:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Lu from Holland is telling me about the full moon party on Koh Lawang that they are going to. She is the oldest of the group, she says, she is 26 and she wants to do all of this before she gets old and can&#8217;t keep up anymore. We watch the muay thai fighters high kick each other, bodies slamming into the ground while the white boys circle the ring and eye up their chances of making it in a fight. Agent B has disappeared.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">-0:30h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Agent B magically reappears while we are eating toasted ham and cheese sandwiches at the 7-11. He got a thai massage and it was great, he says.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">+1:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The young englishman who was knocked out cold in the Raggae Bar Muay Thai ring confirms that it was a kick to the head and not to the chest. His opponent, a hefty irishman and former boxer had unleashed a flurry of precisely aimed blows before the finish, a kick to the head that sent the boy unconscious to the floor of the ring and the locals frantically taking off his protective headgear and shinguards trying to revive him. A tense 5 minutes passed before he got to his feet and walked off the ring.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">+2:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Agent B and Mancunian are getting &#8220;hello sailor&#8221; looks from the many young european ladies flitting around Koh Phi Phi. Hanging out with me (the obligatory female friend) has given them a &#8220;certificate of goodness&#8221; stamped on their foreheads. Or stamped on their derrieres, judging from the direction of the admiring looks that they are getting.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">+11:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Feeling the sand and shell between my toes. Water is too choppy to snorkel with the black tip sharks. But it&#8217;s good to be out in the sun.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">+16:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Maman, je veut une ballon noir de le singe&#8221; The ferry is full of people.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">+18:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">One of the local girlfriends of the old farangs is staring at me while I eat my noodles and sit with my earphones on.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">+20:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">I am getting &#8220;hello hello&#8221; looks from old farangs in the airport terminal. Ergh.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">+22:00h</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Snoozing in the plane. Good night.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Bangkok seemed like a Buddhist version of Islamic Kuala Lumpur, buildings and streets bathed in golden warm tones instead of the leafy green blue hues of Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A trip to Chatuchak market left me soaked in sweat, seriously dehydrated, bags of goodies and with only enough money left in my pocket for the monorail trip back to the hotel. Chatuchak is more than a normal market, more than the &#8220;standard&#8221; Asian markets with squawking chickens, frogs and strange animal parts. Actually it had none of those at all, but had something much better&#8230; products by fresh local young thai designers, indie music shops and baby rabbits in little costumes (absolutely dying in the heat). They also had little chipmunks in costumes. Imagine a chipmunk sized peter pan costume complete with woolen hat, and you have the correct mental image. Now duplicate those chipmunks by 10, and pop them on a little thai lady&#8230;bingo!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I seriously pushed my limits of heat tolerance in that trip, taking buses and walking around all day. Bangkok has some beautiful temples&#8230;I always go and pray whenever I get to visit temples. It&#8217;s nice, makes me feel happier and a feel little bit more peaceful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bangkok was so much fun. Will definitely be doing the Krabi-Bangkok trips in the future <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next email&#8230;I&#8217;ll have to dig my photos of kuala lumpur out of the archives! heehee</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello! Wow these few months have been super busy&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Krabi Thailand was really good, had heard good things from climber friends and it costs less than 50 quid return from Kuala Lumpur. Krabi was exactly what we were looking for &#8211; great beaches, beautiful reef, cheap, not crowded (not being peak season helped), lots of halal food (larger muslim population than say bangkok)&#8230;and just so beautiful <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Did a 3-island hopping trip, including Koh Poda, walking from Chicken Island to Tup Island and some beaches on the mainland. Koh Poda is gorgeous, but the monkeys! We put down our water bottles for 2 seconds, and they came charging straight at us, fangs bared and proceeded to bite open the bottles and start drinking. Round Two: Had to do a Baywatch style sprint (out of the water instead of in) when we saw the monkeys heading towards our bags, although we had put it out of the way across the beach!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Monkey misadventures aside, we had a great time snorkelling, jumping off the boat, climbing caves, watching Miss iNa not realise what the idols in the cave were and be led to put her arms around them in a big hug (the cave is in the photos), sitting in beachside cafes, eating at roadside stalls, running through the rain, watching the boats, swinging, sitting in hammocks, getting stretched out in Thai massages&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next email, bangkok <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  Have a good week,<br />
Shi</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ps: here is something definitely worth watching &#8211; I was really tired after work but made me smile. It&#8217;s a guy called Matt, and he is dancing <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  Enjoy!<br />
