				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Happy belated Chinese New Year. Weather has been crazy, too hot and then too cold (for summer anyway). Tragic bush fires happened and lots of shark attacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They say that one of the lies to tell tourists in Sydney is that people have been attacked by sharks at Bondi Beach..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230;until it actually happened today in Bondi at 730pm<br />
<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/02/12/2490164.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/02/12/2490164.htm</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">there are little ones actually, I&#8217;ve gone scuba diving below Bondi and there are cute little ones (Port Jacksons) and around Maroubra beach there is a dive spot with big grey nurse sharks (sand tiger sharks?) about 100ft down&#8230; anyway best not to think about sharks and just enjoy the water :p</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Went to the Blue Mountains some time ago, it&#8217;s blue because of the eucalyptus oil from the trees. Was good, went to see a 125m tall waterfall..walked for day including going down a 1000-steps stair&#8230;as opposed to UP the stairs as recommended in the tourist guidebook. Some kid on work experience training must have got his hands on that edit&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the trail saw a tiny 3m high waterfall, left feeling cheated. Got back to the car, had a final look at the scenic lookout 5 mins from the car &#8211; and saw the 125m high waterfall. What we saw in the forest was the bottom 3m part (122m covered by the trees)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Things are pretty crazy here&#8230; hope you like the pics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">x<br />
