				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">How do you describe 6 days of living in a tent in the english countryside, seeing amazing bands, acrobats, stalls, sculptures and performers?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">UNREAL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Glastonbury (music festival) again this year &#8211; booked my ticket since December!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Day#1: Arrival.<br />
Carrying tent and setting up wasn&#8217;t too bad. Where are those tentpegs? Oh well, lots of shops so easily sorted. Sun is out, grass is green.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Day #2, #3, #4, #5: Music music music. At various times, we climb to the top of the hill, get Mum tattoos, drink organic coffee, organic cider, eat organic bread, organic big breakfasts, use all types of public loos including the &#8220;comfy crappers&#8221; (no kidding), sit on the grass, walk through mud, stand in the rain, sit on the grass, sit in the sun&#8230;listen to more music.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Night #5:<br />
Prodigy festival closer! Totally mental. Some tall guy behind me was jumping up and down and suddenly stopped. 2 seconds later felt a warm spray on my leg and I ask the guy next to me &#8220;did you drop some water?&#8221; (knowing it wasn&#8217;t, but hoping it was) &#8211; the guy in front me shouts &#8220;ew some guy&#8217;s using my leg as a tree!&#8221; At one point everyone&#8217;s crouching down on the ground &#8211; why? Because they told us to! haha.. That, and crowd-surfers, moshing with 1000s of sweaty new best friends with no room to breath. Was supposed to meet my friend, but got lost amongst 1000s of people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Afterwards I really need to wash everything off. Strip down to a bikini past midnight and subject myself to a cold wash under a tap in the middle of the campgrounds. My breath mists up as walk away feeling refreshed and tingly&#8230;only to walk up to my giggling friend who&#8217;s just happened to walk by and witness the whole scene.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Day 6:<br />
Packing up the tent. Found out where the tent pegs went to, I&#8217;d set the tent up on them. Realised what that hard lump he&#8217;d been sleeping on for the last 5 nights was <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  Heh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amazing 6 days. Not sure if I&#8217;d do 6 days again &#8211; but I will keep an eye out for when the tickets for 2010 come up!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The playlist:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dizzy Rascal, N*E*R*D, Bruce Springsteen, Badly drawn boy, Kep Domino, Bombay Bicycle Club, Prodidgy, Glasvegas, Lady Gaga, The Yeah yeah yeahs, Doves, Priscila Anh, Lily Allen, Spinal Tap, Kasabian, In case of fire, The boxer rebellion and a little of: Jason Mraz, Bon Iver and the music of the penguin cafe orchestra</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have a good one,<br />
Shi</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ps: I forgot to mention in the last email that I also spent a day in Milan. I spent most of the day on the roof of the Il Duomo trying to prise my fingers off the walls (voted #1 most scared asian tourist on the roof)..it was beautiful though <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
