<div style="text-align: left;">heya,</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">it&#8217;s been more than a month that I&#8217;ve been in melbourne and I still think that the weather in this city is crazy, it can be sunny in the morning, then suddenly misty and raining and grey&#8230; just like this Sunday :p</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">So this weekend was quite fun, actually it&#8217;s a long weekend because monday is the labor day holiday so the city of melbourne has a moomba festival! Basically shops, rides, and a parade on monday <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  Also there was &#8220;affordable&#8221; trapeze lessons so I finally got to swing, grab the bars with my knees, swing back and catch on the other end! Soooo happy when I finally managed to do it! I was trying to go too quickly because I was worried I&#8217;d miss the bar &#8211; and instead this stuffed up the swing &#8211; so in trapeze it&#8217;s about the flow&#8230;. hm, there&#8217;s probably a life lesson in this <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </div>
<div style="text-align: left;">There was lots of live music also, some good indie/acoustic bands, silent disco, stuff for the young ones in the daytime, pet-a-reptile tent, waterski competition running all day, also one competition where people dress up as birds or flying machines to &#8220;fly&#8221; off a pier? ehhh I didn&#8217;t manage to wake up for that. I&#8217;m guessing that they flew (or fell with style) into the river.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">We watched the festival fireworks on sunday night on the roof of some building &#8211; I&#8217;m reminiscing about the times watching fireworks with friends on the roof top, I wonder if everyone always sneaks up the fire escape to the water tank / flat roof of the building? I guess everyone has memories like that, which is why indie films try to duplicate those, haha.. But the fireworks were great, even more amazing view. And yes, some of us had a better view than most of us ( look at night view carefully :p )</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">And of course the monday parade! The only thing better than watching a parade is&#8230;. watching your friends, in funny costumes, doing funny things, on floats in the parade! Like wearing white shirts and trousers, pretending to chop a fake tree&#8230; HAHAHAHAHHAHAA</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">So, as I sit here feeling happy about making the trapeze catch.. I hope that you had a good weekend.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">x</div>
