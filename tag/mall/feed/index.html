<p style="text-align: justify;">hullooo</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nice slow weekend, good change after shinkansen-ing between Tokyo-Kyoto last weekend. Went to a house that&#8217;s just been completed by the company, slept in and went to the 7-storey bookstore in Shinjuku. Went out for drinks with people in the company Friday night as a belated welcoming and got royally soaked Saturday evening, rainy season is starting in Tokyo now. House in Tokyo was really interesting because the house plan is closely linked to a Tokyo style of living (duh we&#8217;re in Tokyo) but it was very differently designed from say a Malaysian or Australian plan. Also little details, facade etc. Will put up more pics on www.flickr.com/photos/folio check it out</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Went to the technology department at some of the Tokyo malls and drooled over techie stuff They&#8217;ve got an Olympus MP3 player that with a Darth Vadar slick black front and touch-sensitive face for all controls, smaller and lighter than an Ipod. There is a Sony Vaio desktop, but looks like a laptop with attached speakers at the back. When the keyboard snaps shut, it acts as a hifi with slick black plasma console and when open, it&#8217;s a desktop with plasma screen. It would have been even cooler if you could just undock the desktop from the speaker and use it as a laptop and even cooler if they could have could use an ENGLISH operating systemâ€¦but they can&#8217;t. They even have a Panasonic MP3 player that is a 2cmX2xm silver cube (yes, it is that small) and let&#8217;s not even get started on the handphones, cameras, video cameras, lens&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The downside is all the cool techie stuff (except for Ipods) are in Japanese. The way I use Japanese gizmos here is through trial and error, in fact all the software I use in the office is in Japanese. But most options on the menu bar is in the same place and order so it&#8217;s alright. It also takes me awhile to decipher where plastic/paper/tins go if there are no icons, and I still point to the photos to order my food.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the redeeming things about my apartment is that I have an indirect view of the Shinjuku park. The bad news is that I have to go back to KL in 2 months time because the offer in Tokyo fell but am going to hunt again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Resolve to get myself to Tsukiji (fish market) next week the Sony store and the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laters,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shi.</p>
