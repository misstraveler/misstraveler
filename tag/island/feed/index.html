				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">Island hopping is something I like to do in when in tropical Malaysia, Thailand, Greece or Croatia, but Sydney? Yes, Sydney Harbour has islands. Sydney Harbour also has scuba diving and sharks but that&#8217;s a different story.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Last weekend I hopped on a fast boat and went around to 4 tiny islands: Fort Denison, Clark Island, Shark Island and Garden Island. Fort Denison also used to be known as Pinchgut Island as convicts were left on the island without food for 1 week as punishment and when a fort was built there in the 19th century, construction took so long to build that the cannons went obsolete when it was finally finished. The island hopping was actually part of Crave Sydney, a month long festival, so there were performers on the other islands.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Shark Island is called that for it&#8217;s shape, but it used to be a quarantine island for animals entering australia. This time they had puppeteers with dinosaurs and mystical creatures, including men in t-rex and stegasaurus costumes &#8211; good fun. No, barney the dinosaur was nowhere in sight. Also it&#8217;s a gorgeous place for having a picnic, sydney weather was in fine form that day after weeks of rain and wind, sydney dazzles when the sun is out <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">On Clark Island they had Aboriginal cultural performances (dances, didgeridoo etc), art and some talks/demonstrations about how they used the plants and coastal tides. I really enjoyed it, it was a good insight into how they really lived in harmony with nature. The sad reality is that within 3 years of the european settlers arriving in sydney, an entire aboriginal tribe in the harbour were wiped out by the european disease, smallpox. Disease would wipe out 50% of the aboriginals in australia and their babies taken away (the stolen generation) by the australian government to &#8220;civilize&#8221; them..or to breed them out. No wonder most aboriginals hate white people so much.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://reconciliaction.org.au/nsw/education-kit/stolen-generations/">http://reconciliaction.org.au/nsw/education-kit/stolen-generations/</a></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">But of course they didn&#8217;t mention this on that day but had activities for the kids and we all enjoyed the sun and the beautiful harbour. Last stop was the naval museum that had 1 of the 3 Japanese mini-subs that snuck into the harbour during WW3, got stuck in the nets and torpedoed the wrong boat. 1 sub got lost heading towards Narabeen beach instead of Bondi Beach and the japanese crew committed harakiri (suicide) when found.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">All in all, It was a good day out, I really enjoyed it <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  Hope you like the pics, fingers crossed that summer comes soon, the weather has been horrible lately. Well..horrible for sydney anyway <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </div>

Hey all,

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-539" title="tioman island liveaboard" alt="" src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/collage_tioman1.jpg" width="960" height="960" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hey all,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Went to Tioman Island 2 weeks ago on a liveaboard for that artificial reef launch &amp; Record attempt at most divers in the water (why bother??). The start of the trip was pretty horrible, forgotten gear, a lost 90-year old at the jetty and us getting lost on the way meant that when we got to the jetty we were ready for a good night&#8217;s sleep. No such luck. A storm off the Philipines meant 1-2m high waves coming from no one clear direction. Seasickness tablets were taken and thrown up as people escaped to the top deck for fresh air and hung on for dear life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next morning, we were parked in Monkey Bay (no monkeys were ever seen) in Tulai Island off Tioman. Everyone was still asleep so after rummaging for gear I went out with the captain for spearfishing, rolled overboard and my fin strap snapped. Rats. So couldn&#8217;t go spearfishing but had to go back to the boat. Right then the engine died &#8211; flooded from the storm. Picked up the paddle (more like a stick) and the fins and started rowing back to the boat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Back on the boat, gear was still malfunctioning and a drizzle had started. The sea outside the bay was choppy and the wreck dive was a nightmare with people hanging off the anchor rope literally being pulled away by the current. On a different dive, descending with strong current ended up with people ending up in 5 different groups by the time we reached the bottom and depending on which way you were swept or tried to fight the current most of us didn&#8217;t even see each other at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Malaysian royalty…</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marine Police, Police jetskis, Naval Boats…I wonder why they would need gunner boats, anti-aircraft guns and amphibious vehicles for a reef launch. Underwater, the Prince&#8217;s 4 bodyguards pushed divers floating too close as he shook hands and pulled open a curtain to launch the reef.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">TV crew followed us around underwater and onto the boat as Mark&#8217;s shower became primetime viewing material. We went treasurehunting for numbered golf balls underwater &amp; found 8 out of the 10 tossed around by the marine divers. Cultural dances &amp; dinner in the evening was planned for the VVIPs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">When things took an upturn..</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think things got better right after we bought a carton of Tiger beer and sat on the top deck of the boat watching the fireworks and flares explode literally right above and around us. The pyrotechnics guy had a problem judging distances so it literally exploded on the beach and about 20m above our heads with burnt up flares landing all around us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the highlight was probably the Love Boat that was anchored next to us. The White Dress was brought out and the boys swam over to the Love Boat with a mission to conquer &amp; plunder. Bongos, bongs &amp; beer fuelled the Love Boat&#8217;s inhabitants staccato drum beats as the boys triumphantly jumped off the Love Boat&#8217;s top deck.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Afterwards, we wondered if the Love Boat inhabitants would ever remember the Scotsman in a white dress, the Aussie, the Brit &amp; the Msian who emerged from the midnight waters, charged through the Love Boat and plunged over the side. Or maybe it was all a drug-induced hallucination…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And then there was the White Dress..</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It started as a silly idea about dressing up for the ceremony that was taking place 40ft underwater. Besides, with (the expected) 300 divers all dressed in standard issue black neoprene &amp; faces obscured by masks and regs something was required to rise above the masses. I had a long white dress wth the appropriate ruffles that I reckoned would look quite nice floating underwater. And while I was at it, why not do a leap off the top deck in it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I emerged from the cabin, Mr. M gave a speculative look. &#8220;You know, I wouldn&#8217;t look half bad in that too. I reckon I&#8217;d put that on&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With those words the Ladyboy revelation had arrived, skirts were flared, kisses blown &amp; hairy manboobs flashed. Every manly bloke had an inner Lolita that emerged with the White Dress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest surprise of the day was that, everyone; from a 5&#8217;4&#8243; 50kg Asian girl to the 6&#8217;2&#8243; 95kg Scottish bloke fit into the White Dress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So the rest is history. White sand, crystal clear waters, colorful fish. Good spearfishing and we climbed a small mountain &amp; explored the mangroves. Did a dive with 5 wrecks with no current &amp; I got my mermaid shot &amp; enough memories to fuel me through enough cold London evenings.</p>
