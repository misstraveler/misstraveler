<div style="text-align: left;">heya,</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">it&#8217;s been more than a month that I&#8217;ve been in melbourne and I still think that the weather in this city is crazy, it can be sunny in the morning, then suddenly misty and raining and grey&#8230; just like this Sunday :p</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">So this weekend was quite fun, actually it&#8217;s a long weekend because monday is the labor day holiday so the city of melbourne has a moomba festival! Basically shops, rides, and a parade on monday <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  Also there was &#8220;affordable&#8221; trapeze lessons so I finally got to swing, grab the bars with my knees, swing back and catch on the other end! Soooo happy when I finally managed to do it! I was trying to go too quickly because I was worried I&#8217;d miss the bar &#8211; and instead this stuffed up the swing &#8211; so in trapeze it&#8217;s about the flow&#8230;. hm, there&#8217;s probably a life lesson in this <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </div>
<div style="text-align: left;">There was lots of live music also, some good indie/acoustic bands, silent disco, stuff for the young ones in the daytime, pet-a-reptile tent, waterski competition running all day, also one competition where people dress up as birds or flying machines to &#8220;fly&#8221; off a pier? ehhh I didn&#8217;t manage to wake up for that. I&#8217;m guessing that they flew (or fell with style) into the river.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">We watched the festival fireworks on sunday night on the roof of some building &#8211; I&#8217;m reminiscing about the times watching fireworks with friends on the roof top, I wonder if everyone always sneaks up the fire escape to the water tank / flat roof of the building? I guess everyone has memories like that, which is why indie films try to duplicate those, haha.. But the fireworks were great, even more amazing view. And yes, some of us had a better view than most of us ( look at night view carefully :p )</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">And of course the monday parade! The only thing better than watching a parade is&#8230;. watching your friends, in funny costumes, doing funny things, on floats in the parade! Like wearing white shirts and trousers, pretending to chop a fake tree&#8230; HAHAHAHAHHAHAA</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">So, as I sit here feeling happy about making the trapeze catch.. I hope that you had a good weekend.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">x</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hellooo</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My goldfish bowl (london) is getting colder!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new St. Pancreas train station opened few weeks ago and they had a performance/circus act/parade on Friday night called Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). We started from a street off the main road near the station and followed this parade of lanterns and bands to a &#8220;secret spot&#8221; where there were 3-4 stages set up with tv screens, &#8220;wheel of death&#8221;, tight ropes with people abseiling in, acrobats, orchestra, breakdancing, rappers, singers, beatboxer, bollywood dancers&#8230;it was awesome!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course we couldn&#8217;t feel our feet or fingers afterwards but it was so worth it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Checked out Somerset House (lots of bling bling), the ice rink there, hayward gallery, more London Jazz Week.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today went to Hampton Court Palace where I got really excited in anticipation about getting lost in the garden maze! I didn&#8217;t get lost, but I tried my best and was very disappointed when I found the centre. Good fun though. The ticket guy suggested that I should walk through with my eyes closed next time. And there were a lot of excited children racing through with their disgruntled parents leading the rear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hampton Court Palace is best known for Richard VIII &amp; his many wives. I&#8217;ve heard about him (not educated in Britain, thank you very much!) but still feels like a harsh way to break up with someone. He should have just converted to Islam that permits 4 wives at a time. Very plush interiors, but very spooky when it gets dark (sun starts setting at 330pm now).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway on more important matters&#8230; Bel &amp; Cheryl&#8217;s bro Nat supported a peaceful political demonstration in Kuala Lumpur city 2 weeks ago that resulted in them being tear gassed several times. It&#8217;s illegal to have mass gatherings or criticising the Malaysian government. Nat walked to support the rights of the economically disprivelledged Indians in Malaysia and how they are being ignored by the government. Financial &amp; economic assistance from the government in Malaysia is racially legislated when it should be based on actual needs rather than racial terms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Participation estimated to be up to 30,000 people. Nasty way that the government dealt with it : tear gas &amp; riot soldiers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pics of the incident &amp; Nat&#8217;s personal experience are at his webpage:</p>
<p>http://jelas.info/</p>
<p>Al Jazeera footage (1 1/2 mins long)</p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q6558tY58E&#038;feature=related</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kinda shocking for anyone who&#8217;s visited/lived in KL because it&#8217;s always been peaceful. Malaysian controlled media is doing a fine blanket job on the issue..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Life still goes on in KL I imagine. I was pretty surprised that John Howard&#8217;s finally going&#8230; Gordon Brown is doing ok so far. And England lost against Croatia?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hope your part of the world or your gold fish bowl.. is good</p>
