				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Brrr&#8230; winter down here in the Southern Hemisphere. Been needing to get out for some adventuring, so I hooked up with the mountaineering club for snow camping.</div>
<p>Getting close to nature, snow and all &#8211; sounded like a good idea. Also sounded like something interesting and fun to do, you know, cross country skiing, camping in the snow. As someone who grew up in a tropical country, sleeping outdoors in -7 degree weather was something I never thought I&#8217;d do. But I was kitted out properly, so after the first night of pitching a tent in the snow and in the dark, awoke to some truly spectacular snow covered country with not a soul in sight, except for our tents. Definitely worth it.  Snow was gorgeous and sparkly but felt like fire on the body. Cold is still cold. I was really glad to get home, where clothing doesn&#8217;t freeze solid if left outdoors and hot showers feel like the most friendly water ever. Deeper appreciation for everything after spending a weekend when your sole concern is to feed yourself and not freeze.</p>
<div>Enjoy the pics! Snow! Snow forts! Fireplaces! Ski lifts (didn&#8217;t use them)! Sunset!</div>
<div>Big love,</div>
<div>Shi.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello</p>
<p>Couple of mad sandstorms last week and still not used to getting home dusty every day. Heck, I get dusty the moment I step out of the door in the morning. Anyway that&#8217;s heaps luckier than the hundreds of thousands of labourers who have to slave it out in the sun and dust, so yeah all I have to do is drag my pampered ass from one air conditioned environment to the taxi to the a/c apartment.</p>
<p>Gee after that revelation I feel more energized. I&#8217;m excited! Really! Now pass me my vodka on the rocks… Normal moving/settling-in blues coupled with work stress. This ain&#8217;t no vacation fer sure but at least it gives some interesting photos. So without further ado, here are the pics that will give you all the illusion that I am living a life of luxury! Hahahaha</p>
<p>1. View from my living room at dusk. There is construction taking place in front of the apartments, so we have to be very careful not to fall into the &#8220;tiger traps&#8221; in front of our lobby.</p>
<p>2. Apartment swimming pool (not my apartment block in the background, but mine looks a bit like that) I took a dip last night, it&#8217;s pretty cold and has got little nooks and crannies and bridges and fountains and waterfalls and pool bars…very nice, good for pool parties.</p>
<p>3. Model of Trump&#8217;s pineapple (for those who asked about it) If you think that&#8217;s something to hoo hah about, you should really see everything else being built in Dubai…</p>
<p>4. Ski Dubai and Burj Al Alam (4 storey?) ice sculpture that got into the record books</p>
<p>5. World Islands – each island is a villa</p>
<p>6. Photo evidence of the snazzy cars: Maserati, Porsche 911 Carrera, Benz E SLK, BMW Z4. Bunch of Bentleys and Jaguars parked around the apartments but couldn&#8217;t be stuffed taking those. (waaahhh getting jaded already! Hahaha)</p>
<p>7. Terrace &amp; pool is &#8220;just&#8221; the developer&#8217;s show room – that looked more like a 5-star hotel</p>
<p>But the one funny memory I have this week is myself, the sculpture and the mille feuille I had while watching Middle Eastern tourists bounce off ice walls on rubber inner tubes in Ski Dubai <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>Cheerio!<br />
