				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Hello,</div>
<p>it was so good to get out white water rafting today. So many funny moments, like when tree branches pulled one person out of the boat, so we grabbed an ankle each and pulled her back, with her head dragging in the water. The guide tricking us to tip over at the rapids(failed), trying to get the guide into the water (failed), tree branches managing to snag a paddle so we spent 10 minutes chasing it downstream (success). Earlier, we had to split up into 2 boats so the girls in the other boat reported that all the guys in their boat quickly put their paddles up and sat inside when the guide shouted &#8220;forward&#8221; (paddle) leaving the girls to do all the paddling. After the trip, those guys asked the girls out for a date and .. speechless&#8230;hmmm anyway guys who know how to use a paddle are more appealing :p</p>
<p>Such a good day, we had 1 guide instead of 2 so me and Bel got to do a bit more steering and paddling. It was pretty hard to paddle and video, so at one epic rapids I pushed the camera in my jacket&#8230; and I don&#8217;t know what happened next, but suddenly 4 out of 6 of us were in the water :p It&#8217;s in the video. By the way, two of the girls in the boat actually don&#8217;t know how to swim :S</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">hiya</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">well I kinda have good news and bad news. Bad news first, I suppose. Bad news is no more Tokyo/ Japan photos. Good news are exotic Asia photos and bi-monthly tropical island paradise pics in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wouldn&#8217;t be honest if I didn&#8217;t say that I don&#8217;t feel disappointed about not seeing Tokyo for a while. But after getting 1 week upset stomach after swallowing Tokyo sea water &#8211; tropical coral island paradise doesn&#8217;t sound too bad. But Tokyo is sugoi. Always thankful that I had the chance to be there for a bit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Surfing in wave pool on foam boards is slightly depressing though. Monsoon season for surfing starts late Oct- Nov. Puasa starts in October as well so Selamat Berpuasa!! (evil laugh) Starting work Thursday for slightly higher-than-average pay in architecture firm building Pakistani condominiums so I expect to work like a dog.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also have laryngitis this week so if you hear nothing but deep breathing when you call my number, it&#8217;s not a kinky sex caller, it&#8217;s Shi trying to tell you in her loudest whisper that she has laryngitis. (Already done that a few times)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Am in the midst of juggling GMAT studying, a fever and the shop proposal. Went white water rafing as a final hurrah before becoming a urban zombie. Of course I brought my camera if only to prove that yes, I am turning into a yuppie tourist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kinda tired now, this fever/flu/laryngitis thing is doing strange things to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Have fun,<br />
Shi.</p>
