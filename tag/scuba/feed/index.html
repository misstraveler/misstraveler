				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Hello <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </div>
<div>I was on a boat last weekend. A mad rush to pack on friday evening and then slipping through crazy traffic, across the mountain range, stopping for chinese food in a tin shack on the side of plantation roads and ending up onto a lonely jetty on the east coast of malaysia. A weekend of living on a dive boat with a mix of people &#8211; teenaged virgin divers, old seadogs, bunch of people doing their rescue diver course, singaporeans with expensive underwater filming gear Captain, famous chef mary and the boat crew.</div>
<div>Up early in the morning to view clear warm water (31 celsius), blue skies and coconut trees. Tropical diving awesomeness, with colorful fishes everywhere and water visibility 30m? That means, as clear as swimming pool water. If we weren&#8217;t diving, we were napping, eating or jumping off the side of the boat. Ok, slight correction. This trip, I was the ONLY person jumping off the boat. I did have several &#8220;coaches&#8221; telling me to arch my back more, point my toes and watch out for people flushing the boat toilets (!!)</div>
<div>Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t get to go in the little boat to explore the island and snorkel in the mangroves. Instead I was practising towing, resuscitating on the surface&#8221;unconscious diver&#8221;, &#8220;hysterical diver&#8221;&#8230; and all that fun stuff for rescue diver certification. I learnt several things, firstly it&#8217;s fun to be towed on your back by people &#8220;rescuing&#8221; you. Secondly, it&#8217;s fun to be entertained by noisy people who make many jokes about head jobs, neoprene and orgasm sounds while being rescued (^^) And lastly, if you have to resuscitate an unconscious diver on the surface of the water, keep their head above water and tow them back to the boat, the person would be dead by the time you get there, if they weren&#8217;t already dead when you pulled them to the surface.</div>
<div>Hmm.</div>
<div>Back to the colourful fishes. Did a night dive next to the island, with obligatory bioluminescent plankton arm waving actions&#8230; think leo dicaprio&#8217;s &#8220;beach&#8221; movie (^^) Last dive really made my trip, finally got to swim with a turtle, see a shark and poke my camera at some moray eels. Because we all did a 1 hour dive, almost ran out of air, came up with 4-5 feet swells rocking the boat threatening to bash our heads in with the metal platform, teenaged divers swimming amok all over the place&#8230; who later became extremely seasick teenagers lying half dead around the boat&#8230;.</div>
<div>Good times.</div>
<div>Enjoy the pic! x</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hola to everyone out there who are spending december in the cold or the heat <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Setting the scene..the temperature was humid, muggy and the mosquitoes&#8230; BIG. The flight to Cairns where I would begin my diving adventure was delayed as flights always are. I arrived well after midnight and the next day I woke up late for the boat pickup. Liveaboard diving boat for 2 days and the best part were the full-body lycra stinger suits! No, not really. I kept my boardshorts on and took my stings to the legs with a lot of cursing. Lady-like cursing of course.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stinger suits are lycra skintight costumes to keep jellyfish out and make you look really cool, like a big smurf. So every dive there would be 30 or so smurfs all trudging to the water and jumping in. The diving was good, warm water and 30m visibility. It was overall quite shallow, maybe 40m depth. Night dive was uneventful but it had some amazing phosphorent plankton, like the scene in &#8220;The Beach&#8221; where you wave your hands around and the water explodes in sparkles of light..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No sharks except for 1 juvenile grey reef shark. No turtles either. Or manta rays. But lots of colorful fishes and corals and lots of warm water. The dawn dive was good, except for the 530am wake up call. I didn&#8217;t wake up until I hit the water and then it was worth it. 1 day left to go and I went on a day trip to Lower Isles departing from Port Douglas. I was really &#8220;turtled&#8221; to death there, we spotted 2 turtles from the boat, then I swam with 3 turtles (yay!) and spotted another 2 turtles from the glass bottom boat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was a good trip. I need to do more of it. Love the ocean! <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I hope you&#8217;re all well and keeping warm or cool where you are! Happy holidays!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">x<br />

Hey all,
Went to Tioman Island 2 weeks ago on a liveaboard for that artificial reef launch &#38; Record attempt at most divers in the water &#8230;]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-539" title="tioman island liveaboard" alt="" src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/collage_tioman1.jpg" width="960" height="960" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hey all,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Went to Tioman Island 2 weeks ago on a liveaboard for that artificial reef launch &amp; Record attempt at most divers in the water (why bother??). The start of the trip was pretty horrible, forgotten gear, a lost 90-year old at the jetty and us getting lost on the way meant that when we got to the jetty we were ready for a good night&#8217;s sleep. No such luck. A storm off the Philipines meant 1-2m high waves coming from no one clear direction. Seasickness tablets were taken and thrown up as people escaped to the top deck for fresh air and hung on for dear life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next morning, we were parked in Monkey Bay (no monkeys were ever seen) in Tulai Island off Tioman. Everyone was still asleep so after rummaging for gear I went out with the captain for spearfishing, rolled overboard and my fin strap snapped. Rats. So couldn&#8217;t go spearfishing but had to go back to the boat. Right then the engine died &#8211; flooded from the storm. Picked up the paddle (more like a stick) and the fins and started rowing back to the boat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Back on the boat, gear was still malfunctioning and a drizzle had started. The sea outside the bay was choppy and the wreck dive was a nightmare with people hanging off the anchor rope literally being pulled away by the current. On a different dive, descending with strong current ended up with people ending up in 5 different groups by the time we reached the bottom and depending on which way you were swept or tried to fight the current most of us didn&#8217;t even see each other at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Malaysian royalty…</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marine Police, Police jetskis, Naval Boats…I wonder why they would need gunner boats, anti-aircraft guns and amphibious vehicles for a reef launch. Underwater, the Prince&#8217;s 4 bodyguards pushed divers floating too close as he shook hands and pulled open a curtain to launch the reef.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">TV crew followed us around underwater and onto the boat as Mark&#8217;s shower became primetime viewing material. We went treasurehunting for numbered golf balls underwater &amp; found 8 out of the 10 tossed around by the marine divers. Cultural dances &amp; dinner in the evening was planned for the VVIPs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">When things took an upturn..</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think things got better right after we bought a carton of Tiger beer and sat on the top deck of the boat watching the fireworks and flares explode literally right above and around us. The pyrotechnics guy had a problem judging distances so it literally exploded on the beach and about 20m above our heads with burnt up flares landing all around us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the highlight was probably the Love Boat that was anchored next to us. The White Dress was brought out and the boys swam over to the Love Boat with a mission to conquer &amp; plunder. Bongos, bongs &amp; beer fuelled the Love Boat&#8217;s inhabitants staccato drum beats as the boys triumphantly jumped off the Love Boat&#8217;s top deck.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Afterwards, we wondered if the Love Boat inhabitants would ever remember the Scotsman in a white dress, the Aussie, the Brit &amp; the Msian who emerged from the midnight waters, charged through the Love Boat and plunged over the side. Or maybe it was all a drug-induced hallucination…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-style: italic;">And then there was the White Dress..</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It started as a silly idea about dressing up for the ceremony that was taking place 40ft underwater. Besides, with (the expected) 300 divers all dressed in standard issue black neoprene &amp; faces obscured by masks and regs something was required to rise above the masses. I had a long white dress wth the appropriate ruffles that I reckoned would look quite nice floating underwater. And while I was at it, why not do a leap off the top deck in it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I emerged from the cabin, Mr. M gave a speculative look. &#8220;You know, I wouldn&#8217;t look half bad in that too. I reckon I&#8217;d put that on&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With those words the Ladyboy revelation had arrived, skirts were flared, kisses blown &amp; hairy manboobs flashed. Every manly bloke had an inner Lolita that emerged with the White Dress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest surprise of the day was that, everyone; from a 5&#8217;4&#8243; 50kg Asian girl to the 6&#8217;2&#8243; 95kg Scottish bloke fit into the White Dress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So the rest is history. White sand, crystal clear waters, colorful fish. Good spearfishing and we climbed a small mountain &amp; explored the mangroves. Did a dive with 5 wrecks with no current &amp; I got my mermaid shot &amp; enough memories to fuel me through enough cold London evenings.</p>
