				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Happy belated Chinese New Year. Weather has been crazy, too hot and then too cold (for summer anyway). Tragic bush fires happened and lots of shark attacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They say that one of the lies to tell tourists in Sydney is that people have been attacked by sharks at Bondi Beach..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230;until it actually happened today in Bondi at 730pm<br />
<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/02/12/2490164.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/02/12/2490164.htm</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">there are little ones actually, I&#8217;ve gone scuba diving below Bondi and there are cute little ones (Port Jacksons) and around Maroubra beach there is a dive spot with big grey nurse sharks (sand tiger sharks?) about 100ft down&#8230; anyway best not to think about sharks and just enjoy the water :p</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Went to the Blue Mountains some time ago, it&#8217;s blue because of the eucalyptus oil from the trees. Was good, went to see a 125m tall waterfall..walked for day including going down a 1000-steps stair&#8230;as opposed to UP the stairs as recommended in the tourist guidebook. Some kid on work experience training must have got his hands on that edit&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the trail saw a tiny 3m high waterfall, left feeling cheated. Got back to the car, had a final look at the scenic lookout 5 mins from the car &#8211; and saw the 125m high waterfall. What we saw in the forest was the bottom 3m part (122m covered by the trees)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Things are pretty crazy here&#8230; hope you like the pics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">x<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-660" title="collage_officeparty" alt="" src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/collage_officeparty.jpg" width="960" height="960" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s been a really strange month since I started work at my old company…obviously things have changed &#8211; like people going home before midnight (wimps! hehe) and a healthier regime of after-work yoga lessons, weekend paintball sessions, wall-climbing, waterfall excursion…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Could this really be the same place? Is it possible that KL is having a fresh turnaround of conventional (sweat factory) work-play schedules? Of course not, I started clocking up 10pm, midnight &amp; 4am working nights in the last 2 weeks <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it was good while it lasted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So here&#8217;s the pics of the highlights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Waterfalling was good, drove 2 hours from KL, get off highway for another 45 mins, then offroad (and I mean offroad!) for another 30mins. Walk on path for 5 mins, then scramble through rainforest for 30mins to get to pristine tropical paradise! We got the first pool and it was great to get wet after working up a sweat. Splashed around then continued climbing. We only got through 7 of the 35 falls but the last falls was really beautiful. Jin got washed down 2 of the falls &amp; almost went down the 3 rd and that would have been when we would have to trek all the way down to retrieve his body…but Hugh &amp; Dave got to him in time <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Company dinner was fun too – the theme was superheros and it was at the Shangri-la restaurant. There was She-ra, Lara Croft Buffet Raider, Poison Ivy, Spider-woman, Catwoman, Chun Li (streetfighter), the Recycling Revolutionaries (aka Poison Ivy&#8217;s Ribenaberries), Mr. Bean…obviously a majority of the people didn&#8217;t dress up, but they made up for it with poledancing, man-whoring (just Dean <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  ) The food was good – sushi, oysters, entrees (in little shot glasses), choc fountain etc And our 3d guys are genius impersonators – I must watch myself around those fellas : )</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve been having a lot of fun this past month… oh yeah and uhmm there was this small incident where I sort of broke my finger before xmas &amp; I didn&#8217;t know (yes, my doctors asked me how could you not know?) After my finger was swollen for a month I went to do xrays &amp; now my finger is in this aluminium-sponge-brace thingy… So I&#8217;ve found out that wall-climbing with 3 fingers is not easy, my pen keeps getting stuck in my brace and I now do everything left-handed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sigh. Xrays this week and my finger&#8217;s better than before but still not back to normal (at all). Chinese New Year next week &amp; I&#8217;m already eating myself silly with mandarin oranges.. so…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GONG XI FA CAI WAN SI RU YI !!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  from sunny warm msia<br />
Shi</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ps: Waves are flat in msia! I&#8217;m hoping for one last swell this season…<br />
pps: Does anyone want to go to the KL Muse concert?</p>
