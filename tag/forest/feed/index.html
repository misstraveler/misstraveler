				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The combination of this week&#8217;s pictures seem a bit weird.. like being forced into a basement-like internment camp with armed guards and subsequently the escape to wilderness &#8211; all in a typical Melbourne weekend! No, I haven&#8217;t signed myself up for some extreme boot camp where armed guards force you to lose weight &#8211; fast. Just Underground Cinema where they put you in a movie by recreating scenes and characters from a movie before screening the movie and a trip to the Yarra Ranges which was decimated by bush fires 2 years ago. I&#8217;m pretty stoked that there are such beautiful forests so close to the city! Seems that my dream to do the &#8220;run/trail bike on the weekends in giant forests&#8221; lifestyle isn&#8217;t too far away. Can&#8217;t say the same about my dream about riding a unicorn through giant forests.. hmm. Ok you didn&#8217;t hear that. Olympics in full swing right now, really missing out, I don&#8217;t even have tv! <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  Miss you London lot! Hope all&#8217;s well. Love, Shi. ps: Movie was Children of Men.</p>
