				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s been a long week. But managed to slip in some touristy stuff like:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Jack the Ripper walk &#8211; very good, the guide (an actor by profession) did voices (horny wretches, toff, Cockney, fire truck (??)) , sang, danced &#8211; it was a good night. www.walks.com</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Syon Park Enchanted Woodland Walk &#8211; very very pretty &#8211; they put up lights &amp; effects in the park and it just turns into something else. It&#8217;s also the home of the Duke and Duchess of Northcumberland but unfortunately Their Graces are not part of the exhibit http://www.syonpark.co.uk/</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Hyde Park Winter Wonderland. Ice rink is fully booked til Xmas (I&#8217;ve been told) but it&#8217;s more like a sandy watery rink..better to go to Somerset House. Excited kids, parents, couples, teens &#8211; everyone in London had turned up. Ferris wheel, tube slide, carousel, haunted house, rides, food, stalls for pressies, Santa <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4. VIP shopping weekend &#8211; they closed parts of Oxford Street for shoppers &#8211; jugglers, entertainers etc. There&#8217;s this Argos ad on the telly now that has people sommersaulting over bollards, pushing, shoving&#8230;that was probably based on this event :p</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">5. Columbia Street Flower Market &#8211; oh the glorious smell of pine needles&#8230;mmm 25 pounds for a 5 ft xmas tree..sigh <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6. East London Design Show &#8211; it was good. Didn&#8217;t find any xmas pressies tho <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh yes in my previous email I said that it was Richard VIII &#8211; it should actually have been Henry VIII &#8211; my bad <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly, Henry VIII was eaten by the estate dogs at Syon Park &#8211; considered divine judgement for turning Syon Abbey into Syon House.</p>
<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syon_House</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Got soaked in the rain, it&#8217;s been raining all week. And the story behind that nice graffiti is here:</p>
<p>http://www.banksy.co.uk/outdoors/horizontal_1.htm</p>
<p>It&#8217;s located above the bus stop at the Old Street tube station and the story behind it is worth a read.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&#8217;s it for now..I&#8217;m absolutely knackered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">zzzz<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-660" title="collage_officeparty" alt="" src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/collage_officeparty.jpg" width="960" height="960" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s been a really strange month since I started work at my old company…obviously things have changed &#8211; like people going home before midnight (wimps! hehe) and a healthier regime of after-work yoga lessons, weekend paintball sessions, wall-climbing, waterfall excursion…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Could this really be the same place? Is it possible that KL is having a fresh turnaround of conventional (sweat factory) work-play schedules? Of course not, I started clocking up 10pm, midnight &amp; 4am working nights in the last 2 weeks <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it was good while it lasted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So here&#8217;s the pics of the highlights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Waterfalling was good, drove 2 hours from KL, get off highway for another 45 mins, then offroad (and I mean offroad!) for another 30mins. Walk on path for 5 mins, then scramble through rainforest for 30mins to get to pristine tropical paradise! We got the first pool and it was great to get wet after working up a sweat. Splashed around then continued climbing. We only got through 7 of the 35 falls but the last falls was really beautiful. Jin got washed down 2 of the falls &amp; almost went down the 3 rd and that would have been when we would have to trek all the way down to retrieve his body…but Hugh &amp; Dave got to him in time <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Company dinner was fun too – the theme was superheros and it was at the Shangri-la restaurant. There was She-ra, Lara Croft Buffet Raider, Poison Ivy, Spider-woman, Catwoman, Chun Li (streetfighter), the Recycling Revolutionaries (aka Poison Ivy&#8217;s Ribenaberries), Mr. Bean…obviously a majority of the people didn&#8217;t dress up, but they made up for it with poledancing, man-whoring (just Dean <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  ) The food was good – sushi, oysters, entrees (in little shot glasses), choc fountain etc And our 3d guys are genius impersonators – I must watch myself around those fellas : )</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve been having a lot of fun this past month… oh yeah and uhmm there was this small incident where I sort of broke my finger before xmas &amp; I didn&#8217;t know (yes, my doctors asked me how could you not know?) After my finger was swollen for a month I went to do xrays &amp; now my finger is in this aluminium-sponge-brace thingy… So I&#8217;ve found out that wall-climbing with 3 fingers is not easy, my pen keeps getting stuck in my brace and I now do everything left-handed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sigh. Xrays this week and my finger&#8217;s better than before but still not back to normal (at all). Chinese New Year next week &amp; I&#8217;m already eating myself silly with mandarin oranges.. so…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GONG XI FA CAI WAN SI RU YI !!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  from sunny warm msia<br />
Shi</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ps: Waves are flat in msia! I&#8217;m hoping for one last swell this season…<br />
pps: Does anyone want to go to the KL Muse concert?</p>
