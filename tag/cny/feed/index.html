				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: justify;">Yo! Yo! Yo! Happy chinese new year! Yes, it still is Chinese New Year!</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Chinese New Year is not over until Chap Goh Mei, that is the 15th day of the lunar calendar. Every time I&#8217;m back I&#8217;m tempted to go to the river and throw an orange in during Chap Go Mei.. an orange?? (I can hear you say..)</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The tradition is that young maidens should throw an orange into the river on CGM and they will get a husband. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m meant to write my phone number on the orange also? Or if I&#8217;m feeling particularly desperate I should get a crateful of oranges. A truckload! I&#8217;m at that age when all my relatives ask me when I&#8217;m getting married. I think this is their revenge at me for still collecting red packets (angpao, hongpao, filled with money!) from them. This orange tradition is of course, another strange evolved tradition that started in Malaysia</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chap_Goh_Meh">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chap_Goh_Meh</a></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Oh! And Chinese New Year fell on the same day as Valentine&#8217;s Day! haha&#8230; how was your CNY or Valentine&#8217;s Day? Please keep me informed &#8211; emails are lovely!</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Happy chinese new year! It&#8217;s been a pretty busy past few weeks in KL, with lots of eating, shopping, cookie making, eating&#8230;and more eating. Hmm. There are 3 major races in Malaysia, Malay, Chinese and Indian so we get lots of food from all 3 types &#8211; and then there&#8217;s all the other food from thailand, vietnam, china&#8230; I haven&#8217;t even done many touristy things, just been mostly&#8230;eating!! But CNY is pretty major in Asia &#8211; like Christmas is for Europe. Anyway, enjoy the pics, gong xi fa cai and wishing you a prosperous year of the tiger.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Happy belated Chinese New Year. Weather has been crazy, too hot and then too cold (for summer anyway). Tragic bush fires happened and lots of shark attacks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They say that one of the lies to tell tourists in Sydney is that people have been attacked by sharks at Bondi Beach..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230;until it actually happened today in Bondi at 730pm<br />
<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/02/12/2490164.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/02/12/2490164.htm</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">there are little ones actually, I&#8217;ve gone scuba diving below Bondi and there are cute little ones (Port Jacksons) and around Maroubra beach there is a dive spot with big grey nurse sharks (sand tiger sharks?) about 100ft down&#8230; anyway best not to think about sharks and just enjoy the water :p</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Went to the Blue Mountains some time ago, it&#8217;s blue because of the eucalyptus oil from the trees. Was good, went to see a 125m tall waterfall..walked for day including going down a 1000-steps stair&#8230;as opposed to UP the stairs as recommended in the tourist guidebook. Some kid on work experience training must have got his hands on that edit&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of the trail saw a tiny 3m high waterfall, left feeling cheated. Got back to the car, had a final look at the scenic lookout 5 mins from the car &#8211; and saw the 125m high waterfall. What we saw in the forest was the bottom 3m part (122m covered by the trees)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Things are pretty crazy here&#8230; hope you like the pics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">x<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-660" title="collage_officeparty" alt="" src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/collage_officeparty.jpg" width="960" height="960" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s been a really strange month since I started work at my old company…obviously things have changed &#8211; like people going home before midnight (wimps! hehe) and a healthier regime of after-work yoga lessons, weekend paintball sessions, wall-climbing, waterfall excursion…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Could this really be the same place? Is it possible that KL is having a fresh turnaround of conventional (sweat factory) work-play schedules? Of course not, I started clocking up 10pm, midnight &amp; 4am working nights in the last 2 weeks <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it was good while it lasted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So here&#8217;s the pics of the highlights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Waterfalling was good, drove 2 hours from KL, get off highway for another 45 mins, then offroad (and I mean offroad!) for another 30mins. Walk on path for 5 mins, then scramble through rainforest for 30mins to get to pristine tropical paradise! We got the first pool and it was great to get wet after working up a sweat. Splashed around then continued climbing. We only got through 7 of the 35 falls but the last falls was really beautiful. Jin got washed down 2 of the falls &amp; almost went down the 3 rd and that would have been when we would have to trek all the way down to retrieve his body…but Hugh &amp; Dave got to him in time <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Company dinner was fun too – the theme was superheros and it was at the Shangri-la restaurant. There was She-ra, Lara Croft Buffet Raider, Poison Ivy, Spider-woman, Catwoman, Chun Li (streetfighter), the Recycling Revolutionaries (aka Poison Ivy&#8217;s Ribenaberries), Mr. Bean…obviously a majority of the people didn&#8217;t dress up, but they made up for it with poledancing, man-whoring (just Dean <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  ) The food was good – sushi, oysters, entrees (in little shot glasses), choc fountain etc And our 3d guys are genius impersonators – I must watch myself around those fellas : )</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve been having a lot of fun this past month… oh yeah and uhmm there was this small incident where I sort of broke my finger before xmas &amp; I didn&#8217;t know (yes, my doctors asked me how could you not know?) After my finger was swollen for a month I went to do xrays &amp; now my finger is in this aluminium-sponge-brace thingy… So I&#8217;ve found out that wall-climbing with 3 fingers is not easy, my pen keeps getting stuck in my brace and I now do everything left-handed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sigh. Xrays this week and my finger&#8217;s better than before but still not back to normal (at all). Chinese New Year next week &amp; I&#8217;m already eating myself silly with mandarin oranges.. so…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GONG XI FA CAI WAN SI RU YI !!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  from sunny warm msia<br />
Shi</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ps: Waves are flat in msia! I&#8217;m hoping for one last swell this season…<br />
pps: Does anyone want to go to the KL Muse concert?</p>
