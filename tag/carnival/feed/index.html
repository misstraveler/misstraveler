				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Time seemed to pass way too quickly while I was in London, I was sort of dashing in and out of london going to different european cities but I finally got some down time in London &#8211; and then spent a week with some ladies from the UK and all over the world &#8220;sight seeing&#8221; around London. Well.. my kind of &#8220;sight-seeing&#8221; anyway :p Very tiring fun, couldn&#8217;t really lower myself onto a chair, sort of just collapsing in a soft jelly. Heh. Good fun.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">London in the summer is great fun, with lots of festivals going on, I was trying to be more relaxed on this trip but in looking at the pics I really did have a good time. Carnivale Pueblo is touted as the biggest latin american festival in europe, but in true summer style, we missed the parade, slept, ate and drank through the performances and just lay in the sunshine. Kyoto Garden was very beautiful, I was rained on for a bit but without the people it only made became more serene. It kept on raining that day and eventually I got to the Royal Albert Hall so I ducked in for the BBC Proms <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />  And I revisted my childhood at the V&amp;A Museum of Childhood, which has all sorts of toys from all centuries including a great selection of toys from the 1980s &#8211; Carebears, He Man, Ninja Turtles. Kind of funny seeing my old toys (that mum has already given to charity) put into glass boxes, and also some great illustrations by Quentin Blake for Road Dahl..remember him? Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Fantastic Mr Fox, Monkey, Pelly and Me? Ahhhh&#8230;</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The more you get to know about a place, the more facets you can discover, but London is one city that is definitely diverse in all senses. It was great to meet up with everyone..almost everyone! I missed out quite a few people&#8230;sorry &#8211; my bad. But I do love a global rendezvous &#8211; pick a city and I&#8217;ll meet you there! <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />  I met up with one friend from sydney who&#8217;s living in singapore for 2 hours in milan! Was awesome, I love how small this world is..</div>
