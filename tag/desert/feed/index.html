<div style="text-align: justify;">I don&#8217;t know what possessed me to book a 4 day train from Sydney to perth. My friend&#8217;s reaction to me renting a bicycle in Paris was &#8220;You? You? I never thought of you as that type&#8221; and then he was shocked wordless for the next few minutes. Honestly, I surprised even myself by buying a ticket for a seat (not a bed) on the train, but I crossed my fingers and hoped the air-con would work throughout the trip. 4,352km to cover, top speed of 110kmph, but usually going at 80kmph.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The seat turned out to be comfortable enough if you&#8217;re 5 feet tall, skinny, flexible, wear an eye mask, ear plugs, bring your own pillow, sheets and can sleep through constant shifting and clanking of a train. And the air-con worked in the passenger carriage but later, not in the dining car, which turned into a mini sauna in the desert heat.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The train makes stops at several places along the way to refuel and fill up the water tanks, they included Broken Hill, Adelaide, Cook and Karlgoolie. They organized tours of these places (additional cost) and it was a chance to see places that I&#8217;d not normally go to. Australia is BIG. Australia is so big that it costs a lot to go anywhere. Adelaide is not on the top of my list, but it turned out to be a city with a lot of beautiful buildings, old houses and parks. Or going to Cook, a ghost town in the desert with a population of 4 people and 1 billion flies. Or Kalgoorlie, gold mining town with the SuperPit &#8211; a hole 300m in the ground. When you live in a country with the &#8220;Big Banana&#8221;, &#8220;Giant Merino (Sheep)&#8221;, &#8221; Giant Prawn&#8221;, &#8220;Giant Pineapple&#8221;&#8230;you kind of go&#8230; &#8220;ahhh.. yes.. the SUPERPIT&#8221;.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">As in Amsterdam, you can also tour the red-light district of Kalgoorlie, all 3 brothels of it. By the way, the youth hostel is located across the street from the brothels so please don&#8217;t turn the wrong way if you decide to stay in Kalgoorlie. Skimpies (sexy barmaids) in the hotel bars are part of Kalgoorlie tradition, locals also elected a transsexual brothel madam to council.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In a sense, I feel incredibly privileged to have seen all of it. Unfortunately after this privilege, I felt malnourished, fatigued and dehydrated. Almost like I&#8217;d crossed the desert by myself. If the opportunity ever comes up again to choose between a train or a plane between perth and sydney &#8211; PLANE! PLANE! PLANE! (but I can only say that after doing the train)</div>
