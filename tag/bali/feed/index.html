<p style="text-align: justify;">Hi yall</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Latest news is that I left Dubai 1 month ago after resigning from my job (early Oct), so I won&#8217;t be back there anytime soon. It is a long<br />
story but the only thing that matters is that I&#8217;m happier now : )</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I finally managed to be all touristy in Dubai and did the dune safari, waterpark and in the months before and after leaving Dubai. Also went to Paris, London, Rotterdam &amp; Delft before leaving Dubai and Bali after leaving. Next month I&#8217;m doing a trip to Turkey and Greece because it&#8217;s been years since I spent time with my parents and because I also enjoy unique forms of torture! <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So we go…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paris: Uniquely french, beautiful bouelavards, quai-branly, cafes, parks and oh the food!<br />
London: Fast, hurried and very very Brit-ish. Tate Modern, Blue Men Theatre, Notting Hill Festival and french food in Covent Garden. Do yourself a favour and don&#8217;t try english food unless it&#8217;s from a gastro pub.<br />
Rotterdam: Grey nauticalism and streaks of creativity – Calatrava, Renzo Piano, Foster in one glance.<br />
Delft: Canals, bicycles, old town squares and university life.<br />
Dubai dune bashing: Sand, vertical 4wd, grumpy camels, camel dung, shisha and dune skiing.<br />
Dubai Wild Wadi: Flowriders and water slides.<br />
Bali: Surf trips are always fun. We ate extra well this trip thanks to Diah&#8217;s local knowledge of best restaurants in bali <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&#8217;s it for now, I&#8217;m going for dinner! Write me sometime&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh yeah,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I went to bali for a week. Yes, again. In less than 24 hours after saying &#8220;I&#8217;m in&#8221;, went to the airport, bought a ticket and flew to bali. Week-long public holiday in malaysia because of hari raya adil fitri and deepavali (indian), I love muliticulturalism.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">bali is a lot nicer during off-peak season, balinese people are friendlier, you see little kids playing in the shops and there are sessions where we surfed centres in kuta reef 2 days in a row with just the three of us, solid overhead (and bigger) and water so clear I correctly identified lettuce coral (it&#8217;s coral shaped like a lettuce, big duh).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Didn&#8217;t do much actually. Did all the cultural stuff during my long trip the last time. Just did a morning surf sesh, ate, napped, surfed, ate, went out, slept (X7).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A good holiday that I really can&#8217;t remember what happened <img src="http://misstraveler.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But here are some highlights (and lowlights):<br />
I boarded the plane but my luggage and board didn&#8217;t &#8211; so had to borrow guy friend&#8217;s shirt and went walking around kuta for a day looking like a 12-year old japanese boy. Interestingly, I didn&#8217;t get offered drugs or women (if I had really looked like a man), and didn&#8217;t get chatted up (if I had looked like a woman)<br />
Being introduced to everyone as &#8220;his little brother&#8221; for 1 week afterwards.<br />
Hung out with a friend working at Hard Rock Hotel to do paddle board races in the Hard Rock Hotel pool.<br />
Was fun, jumped on the slides after that.<br />
Accidentally met long-lost american surfer chik whom I first met in bali 1 1/2 yrs back &#8211; in the lineup in kuta beach. (hooray!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the solo female, taking the boys window shopping with me and then having to wait 2 hours while they finished shopping. Got punched on the leg a few times for singing Elmo&#8217;s song out loud on the motorbike. Can&#8217;t help it if its the only song I know&#8230;. Eating nasi goreng almost everyday. Became malnourished after 5 days. Got cranky unless I sat in an air-conditioned shop/bar/restaurant/internetcafe for at least 30 minutes every night.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The swell that we thought wasn&#8217;t going to hit Malaysia did arrive while we were in bali. And in case you&#8217;re wondering, yes, there were still tourists in bali but mostly from jakarta, malaysian &#8211; mostly asians. Only asians in the Mcdonalds, KFC, Hard Rock and haagen-daaz. The aussies and europeans went underground into the local warongs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">hope you like the pic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cheers,<br />
