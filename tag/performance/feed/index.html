				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Hellooo</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My goldfish bowl (london) is getting colder!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new St. Pancreas train station opened few weeks ago and they had a performance/circus act/parade on Friday night called Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). We started from a street off the main road near the station and followed this parade of lanterns and bands to a &#8220;secret spot&#8221; where there were 3-4 stages set up with tv screens, &#8220;wheel of death&#8221;, tight ropes with people abseiling in, acrobats, orchestra, breakdancing, rappers, singers, beatboxer, bollywood dancers&#8230;it was awesome!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course we couldn&#8217;t feel our feet or fingers afterwards but it was so worth it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Checked out Somerset House (lots of bling bling), the ice rink there, hayward gallery, more London Jazz Week.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today went to Hampton Court Palace where I got really excited in anticipation about getting lost in the garden maze! I didn&#8217;t get lost, but I tried my best and was very disappointed when I found the centre. Good fun though. The ticket guy suggested that I should walk through with my eyes closed next time. And there were a lot of excited children racing through with their disgruntled parents leading the rear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hampton Court Palace is best known for Richard VIII &amp; his many wives. I&#8217;ve heard about him (not educated in Britain, thank you very much!) but still feels like a harsh way to break up with someone. He should have just converted to Islam that permits 4 wives at a time. Very plush interiors, but very spooky when it gets dark (sun starts setting at 330pm now).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway on more important matters&#8230; Bel &amp; Cheryl&#8217;s bro Nat supported a peaceful political demonstration in Kuala Lumpur city 2 weeks ago that resulted in them being tear gassed several times. It&#8217;s illegal to have mass gatherings or criticising the Malaysian government. Nat walked to support the rights of the economically disprivelledged Indians in Malaysia and how they are being ignored by the government. Financial &amp; economic assistance from the government in Malaysia is racially legislated when it should be based on actual needs rather than racial terms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Participation estimated to be up to 30,000 people. Nasty way that the government dealt with it : tear gas &amp; riot soldiers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pics of the incident &amp; Nat&#8217;s personal experience are at his webpage:</p>

<p>Al Jazeera footage (1 1/2 mins long)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Kinda shocking for anyone who&#8217;s visited/lived in KL because it&#8217;s always been peaceful. Malaysian controlled media is doing a fine blanket job on the issue..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Life still goes on in KL I imagine. I was pretty surprised that John Howard&#8217;s finally going&#8230; Gordon Brown is doing ok so far. And England lost against Croatia?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hope your part of the world or your gold fish bowl.. is good</p>
