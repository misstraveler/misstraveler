				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Got on the (vintage?) boat at Split, went to Hvar, Korcula, Dubrovnik, Mljet and back to Split. Boat trip was good yet with really bad weather and the boat nearly capsized so we were forced to dock until the wind died down. Water in Croatia is unbelievably clear that you can see fish swimming at the ocean bottom from where the boat is docked. Croatian boats also purge the entire contents of their sewerage tanks while docked at the harbour, which makes life interesting when right around the corner is the island&#8217;s open ocean swimming pool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sleeping in sardine can cabins are pretty cool as long as you are 163cm tall like me. I managed to put my head to the basin from the top bunk (brushing teeth without touching gunky carpet) and put one foot on one wall and one foot on the other, possibly at the same time because it did get pretty rough on the ocean. Still, the cabins aren&#8217;t that small because one girl pulled a guy from the next boat and they somehow did the honky tonk on the sticky 80cm by 120cm plastic carpet with only a fabric curtain covering the doorway. Yeeeeee-haaaa&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cabin gymnastics aside, I spent most of the days with earphones on, drawing, looking at the amazing croatian cliffs, watching sunrises, sunsets, jumping off the boat, swimming, visiting the islands, climbing castles..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And most favourite of all, stepping off the rail, watching the horizon disappear, tilt, crystal clear blue water, bubbles and coming up for air.. Some memories are good stored away for a rainy day.</p>
